# Randest - Tower Defense Driven Development (TDDD)

A framework that makes testing software systems easier and more fun, like playing tower defense (TD) games. It is especially suited for complex, asynchronous and even distributed systems.

Think of the events pouring into your system as the invading critters and writing code to handle them as carefully placing towers to handle the invasion.

Randest is NOT a graphic or gaming framework. The image above is from "Flash Tower Defense 2" and is just conceptual.


# Why?
1. Even when I am bored and tired of coding, I can still spend several hours playing TD. Beyond graphics and sound, I feel the **reactive** mindset needed to play is much more relaxing, more engaging and less demanding than the **proactive** mindset needed to come up with traditional test cases.

2. Traditional testing techniques are just not good enough to test complex interaction of asynchronous code. Randest was created to test [Sneer](http://sneer.me).
