# Randest - Tower Defense Driven Development (TDDD)

A framework that makes testing software systems easier and more fun, like playing tower defense (TD) games. It is especially suited for complex, asynchronous, distributed systems.

Think of the events pouring into your system as the invading critters and writing code to handle them as carefully placing towers to handle the invasion.

Traditional testing techniques are just not good enough to test complex interaction of asynchronous code.
